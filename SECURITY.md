# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I take security bugs in very seriously, and I release patches for security vulnerabilities asap.

I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings,
and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Which versions are eligible for security patches:

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities to nmihai_2000@yahoo.com.  
I will try hard to respond within 24 hours.  
If the issue is confirmed, I will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity, hopefully within days.

But I am working on this alone, and I have a full time job.  
Please be understanding, s**t can happen (think vacations, work crunch time, emergencies, hit by a bus, etc. :-)
